		<h3>HTML</h3>
		<p><b><i>HTML</i></b> or HyperText Markup Language is the standard markup language used to create <u>web pages</u>.</p>
		<p><b><i>HTML</i></b> is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs, although some tags represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example. The first tag in a pair is the start tag, and the second tag is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).</p>

		<h3>Java</h3>
		<p><strong><em>Java</em></strong> is a computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.</p>
		<p><strong><em>Java</em></strong> applications are typically compiled to bytecode (class file) that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. Java is, as of 2014, one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.</p>
